Welcome to our **Airbnb Clone**, a project aimed at recreating the core functionalities of the popular accommodation rental platform, Airbnb. This project demonstrates a full-stack application development with emphasis on user authentication, property listings, booking systems, and more.

## Project Overview

This clone aims to provide:

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Property Listings**: Hosts can list properties with descriptions, photos, pricing, and availability.
- **Search and Filters**: Users can search for accommodations based on location, date, price, and other amenities.
- **Booking System**: A functional booking system where guests can request bookings, and hosts can approve or reject them.
- **Reviews and Ratings**: Users can review properties and hosts, and hosts can review guests, providing a feedback system.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for state management, styled with CSS or a component library like Material-UI.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for the server, handling API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing listings, user data, bookings, etc.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Availability**: Calendar integration to show and manage property availability.
- **Messaging System**: In-app messaging for communication between guests and hosts.
- **Payment Integration**: Simulated payment processing (in a real-world scenario, this would integrate with services like Stripe).
- **User Profiles**: Hosts can update their profiles with additional information and photos.
